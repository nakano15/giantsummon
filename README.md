# Introduction
This is the 1.3 version of TerraGuardians mod.
For 1.4.4.9 version, check this source: https://github.com/nakano15/terraguardians

Confusing, isn't? This is the source of TerraGuardians mod.

If you don't know what TerraGuardians mod is, It is a companion mod for Terraria. It allows you to have custom companion, unlike Terrarian characters, aswell as Terrarian looking like companions. Since the mod is made by me (Nakano15), that means not only that is in the mod.

The TerraGuardians themselves are human-animal mixed creatures with different appearances and status. Due to the fact that they come in varied sizes, colors and styles, that means I'm not bound into making them Terrarian like.

# Source Map

Buffs = This is where the custom mod buffs are sent.

Compatibility = Scripts for other mod compatibilities are sent here.

Companions = Companions base definitions and their sprites are contained here. This is unrelated to their npc. If you want to avoid spoilers, better not check this. And if you want to avoid major spoilers, avoid their scripts. Creatures folder is for TerraGuardians companions, while Terrarians is for Human companions.

Extra = Only has Sardine's sprite for when his recruit npc spawns inside the King Slime.

GuardianNPC = This is where the npc definition of the guardians are placed. Their head sprite is necessary to see them in the world map.

GuardianArmorAndSetEffects.cs = Here is placed the scripts for what each equipment and set will offer to the companion.

GuardianManagement.cs = Opens the guardian inventory and equipment, when clicking on the Inventory button at the Guardian Selection Interface.

GuardianMouseOverAndDialogueInterface.cs = This is a mistake. I mean, handles mouse over, and also dialogues of the companions. The issue with this is if you need the help of this script file to make dialogues happen. I created Dialogue class to try easing the need of this class to handle it.

GuardianOrderHudNew.cs = The script of the new order hud.

#Finishing up
Well, that's about it. By the way, take it easy, It's the first time I'm using github to backup my codes. The method I were using until today, was zipping my mod source and sending to my Mega account.
